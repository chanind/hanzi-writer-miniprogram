This component can be used in a Wechat miniprogram to add Hanzi Writer for character stroke animations and quizzing.

## Installation

```
npm install hanzi-writer-miniprogram
```

## Usage

In your `page.json`, first add the following to enable the `hanzi-writer-view` component:

```json
{
  "usingComponents": {
    "hanzi-writer-view": "hanzi-writer-miniprogram/hanzi-writer-view"
  }
}
```

Then, add a `hanzi-writer-view` component to your page. You must add an `id`, `width`, and `height`, like below:
```
<hanzi-writer-view id="hz-writer" width="300" height="300" />
```

Then in your page, you can control the view via `createHanziWriterContext(options)`, like below:

```javascript
import createHanziWriterContext from 'hanzi-writer-miniprogram';

Page({
  onLoad: function() {
    this.writerCtx = createHanziWriterContext({
      id: 'hz-writer',
      character: '你',
      page: this,
    });

    // You can call any normal HanziWriter method here
    this.writerCtx.loopCharacterAnimation();
  }
});
```

This method requires the `id` from the `hanzi-writer-view` component in wxml, and the current `page`.

By default, character data is loaded from the hanzi-writer CDN, so you'll need to add https://cdn.jsdelivr.net to your [list of approved domain names](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/dev/framework/ability/network.html). Otherwise, you can provide your own `charDataLoader` function and load character data however you like. You can [read more about loading character data here](https://chanind.github.io/hanzi-writer/docs.html#loading-character-data-link).

You can also pass any other normal Hanzi Writer options to `createHanziWriterContext`, except for `width` and `height` which are set in the `hanzi-writer-view` component. You can see a [full list of options here](https://chanind.github.io/hanzi-writer/docs.html#api-link).

## Data source

The chinese character svg and stroke order data used by Hanzi Writer is derived from the [Make me a Hanzi](https://github.com/skishore/makemeahanzi) project with some slight tweaks. The data can be found in the [Hanzi Writer Data](https://github.com/chanind/hanzi-writer-data) repo. There's a visualizer for this data [here](https://chanind.github.io/hanzi-writer-data).
